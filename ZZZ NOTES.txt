JEKYLL BOOGALOO NOTES

SETUP
- bundle add webrick before testing site locally (bundle exec jekyll serve)
- http://localhost:4000/jekyll-boogaloo/
- created page with github instructions rather than jekyll https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll

JEKYLL
- jekyll content: pages (standalone) and posts (for blog)
- for variables and metadata (ex: title, layout) add YAML front matter to any markdown or html file
- categories info https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/
- post filenames must be YYY-MM-DD-NAME.md

PROBLEMS
- headers display properly in github edit, but on webpage header 1 is too small
- categories show up in post url, not sure if they're supposed to
